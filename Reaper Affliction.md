"The Reaper Affliction was a horrific disease that swept across the surface world of Skórnid-líf, leaving nothing but death and destruction in its wake. It is said that the first signs of the affliction were a fever and a maddening thirst for flesh. Those who were infected rapidly degenerated into shambling, zombie-like creatures, driven by an insatiable hunger for the flesh of the living.

As the infected perished, their bodies decomposed in a manner unlike any seen before. Rather than decaying into the earth, their spirits were released, taking on a ghostly, reaper-like form that was immune to harm and driven by a thirst for destruction. These spirits roamed the land, laying waste to everything in their path, until nothing was left but barren wastelands dotted with the husks of once-great cities.

The dwarves of Skórnid-líf were forced to flee underground, seeking refuge in the depths of their ancestral halls. Here, they have lived in relative safety ever since, watching as the reaper spirits continue to haunt the surface world, waiting for the day when they will finally be able to reclaim the land that was once theirs."

[]: # Skórnid-líf, a world shrouded in darkness, was once a thriving land of towering mountains and rolling hills. But the arrival of the Dauoi Veiker, the reaper affliction, changed all that. The surface was devastated, leaving the dwarves, the hardy inhabitants of Skórnid-líf, with no choice but to flee to the depths below.

[]: # The dwarves have adapted to life in the underground tunnels and caverns, carving out a new existence among the shadows. Despite the danger that lurks above, they have found a way to survive and even thrive in the darkness. With their stout hearts and their unbreakable spirit, the dwarves of Skórnid-líf persevere, reminding all that beneath the darkness, there is life."


"The entity responsible for the Reaper Affliction is known among the dwarves of Skórnid-líf as "Helgrafen" (The Hallowed Reaper). This ominous figure is said to take the form of a shadow with long, sharp finger-like tendrils, capable of infecting any living thing it touches.

The affliction caused by Helgrafen was truly horrific. Victims would rapidly degenerate into mindless husks, driven by an insatiable hunger to kill and consume anything in their path. When they died, their bodies would decompose at an alarming rate, releasing a cloud of noxious fumes that would turn the land around them into a barren, bubbling wasteland.

These clouds of noxious fumes would release shape-shifting apparitions, similar in form to the Helgrafen itself, that would go on to infect others and spread the affliction further. The dwarves of Skórnid-líf were forced to flee underground, seeking refuge in the depths of their ancestral halls.

To this day, The Helgrafen continues to roam the surface world of Skórnid-líf, spreading its deadly affliction and leaving nothing but death and destruction in its wake."

## Wards Sacrifice
The dwarves of Skórnid-líf once lived above ground, but were forced to flee underground when the Reaper Affliction, caused by Helgrafen, swept across the surface. In a desperate effort to protect themselves, the dwarves came up with a plan to create powerful wards that would keep the Reaper Affliction at bay.

To do so, they made a terrible sacrifice, offering up many of their own kind to empower the wards. These dwarves were chosen for their strength, their courage, and their unwavering devotion to their people. They were sealed within the wards, their life force fueling the magic that kept Helgrafen and the Reaper Affliction confined to the surface.

The dwarves of Skórnid-líf remember their fallen kin with great reverence, and the wards are treated as sacred places, visited only by the most pious and the bravest of their people. They believe that the spirits of those who were sealed within the wards continue to guard their people, protecting them from the horrors that wait above.

For generations, the dwarves have lived in safety, far from the reach of Helgrafen and the Reaper Affliction. But they know that one day, the magic of the wards will begin to fade, and they will be forced to face the Hallowed Reaper once again. Until that day, they work tirelessly to prepare themselves, honing their skills and their strength in preparation for the final battle.


in Skórnid-líf, the surface of the world remains shrouded in mystery and fear, despite the powerful wards that protect the dwarves from the dangers that lie above. strange sounds and eerie cries are said to filter through, suggesting that something still stirs above. Nevertheless, brave adventurers have been known to venture forth, offering gifts to the spirits of those who were sealed within the great ward when it was created.

Although these adventurers remain safely within the boundaries of the ward, they claim to be able to see haunting shapes and masses moving just beyond the barrier, to hear the sound of great tearing and scraping, and to feel an overwhelming feeling of dread that permeates the surface.

they do not forget the sacrifices that were made, and they continue to offer gifts and perform rituals in honor of those who gave their lives to protect their people.

The surface of Skórnid-líf remains one of the greatest mysteries of the world, ~~and perhaps one day, a brave explorer will be bold enough to venture forth and unlock its secrets. Until then,~~ the dwarves will continue to watch over their wards, and the spirits of the sacrifices will remain a silent and ghostly presence, guarding their people from the horrors above.

## Origin

The origin of Helgrafen is unknown, shrouded in mystery and legends passed down from generation to generation of dwarves. Some tales claim that Helgrafen was once a powerful being from another world, who was cast out for its terrible deeds and now seeks to spread death and destruction wherever it goes.

Others whisper that it is a manifestation of death itself, a force of nature that has taken on a sentient form and seeks to bring an end to all life. Regardless of its origin, Helgrafen is regarded by the dwarves of Skórnid-líf as a malevolent entity that must be avoided at all costs.

The dwarves have learned to live in the shadows of their ancestral halls, relying on their cunning and their skill as miners and builders to survive. They fear the day when Helgrafen will discover their hiding place and seek to extinguish their race once and for all. Until that day, they keep watch, always vigilant for any sign of the Hallowed Reaper's approach.
