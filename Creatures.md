Version 0.1

Skórnid-líf, a world shrouded in darkness, was once a thriving land of towering mountains and rolling hills. But the arrival of the Dauoi Veiker, the reaper affliction, changed all that. The surface was devastated, leaving the Skórnid-líf, the hardy inhabitants of Skórnid-líf, with no choice but to flee to the depths below and live in the shadows of their once mighty ancestral halls.

The Kalt-Leidir have adapted to life in the underground tunnels and caverns, carving out a new existence among the shadows. they have found a way to survive and even thrive in the darkness. With their stout hearts and their unbreakable spirit, the Kalt-Leidir of Skórnid-líf persevere, reminding all that "within the darkness, there is life"."

They are short in stature but powerful race, with skin as hard as rock, and immense raw strength reflecting the centuries they have spent tunneling and building their underground dwellings, they use a form of blood magic to form barrier and imbue crafts and buildings with power. 

Born and raised beneath the earth, they have never seen the sun and are pale with streaks of crimson showing through there translucent skin, with eyes that have adapted to absorb any glimmer of light that penetrates their world. with large white beards streaked with crimson and hairless heads, they are a fearsome sight to behold.

### Physical Description

The Kalt-Leidir have evolved to life in the darkness of underground caverns, and as a result, their physical appearance reflects this environment. They are pale, almost translucent, with skin that has taken on a faint red hue from the streaks of crimson that run beneath it. This gives them an otherworldly appearance, as if they are creatures born from the shadows themselves.

Their eyes are large and dark, designed to absorb every glimmer of light that penetrates the caverns, and their hair is long and red, a symbol of their fiery spirit. Their beards are long, thick and unkempt, befitting of their rough and rugged appearance.

Their bodies are muscular and powerful, a result of the centuries they have spent tunneling and building in the underground. Their skin is rough and calloused, almost like the texture of rough hewn marble, reflecting the harsh environment they have come to call home. They stand short and broad, with large hands and feet, adapted to the work they do in the tunnels.

Their appearance is one of great strength and resilience, a symbol of the Kalt-Leidir's ability to survive and thrive in the shadows.

Skaoi-Flayers

"The goblin-like insects known as Skaoi-Flayers, are a formidable and feared species. They are hatched in massive fetid mud pits deep in the caverns, after being laid by the Queen (name) fully grown and ravenous, with a singular purpose: to consume. These creatures, with their chitinous exoskeletons and razor-sharp mandibles, quickly eliminate and consume the weaker of their broodmates, ensuring only the strongest and most cunning survive.

Their mud-covered bodies are perfectly adapted for life in the dark caverns and tunnels, allowing them to move with speed and stealth. Their multifaceted eyes gleam with an eerie light, and their long, spindly legs make them incredibly agile and quick.

Despite their formidable appearance and vicious nature, the insect goblins are highly intelligent and capable of complex communication and strategic thinking. They have been known to band together to attack larger prey, and their tactics are as brutal as they are effective.

The dwarves of Skórnid-líf regard these creatures with caution and respect, for they are formidable enemies and should not be underestimated. In the dark depths below, only the strong survive, and the insect goblins are certainly among the strongest of Skórnid-líf's denizens."

"The goblin-like insects, known as the Skaði-flærs, are a powerful and malevolent species that emerge from the depths of massive, putrid mud pits. Born from the eggs laid by their Queen, she is a feared and revered figure among her kin, a ruler of darkness and a harbinger of destruction.

The Queen of the Skaði-flær is a truly imposing figure, her massive size and strength matched only by her cunning and intelligence. The dwarves of Skórnid-líf tremble at the mere mention of her name, for she is known to lead her armies of Skaði-flær in raids against their settlements, seeking to consume all in her path.

She is known simply as "Móðir Skaði" (Mother of Destruction). A fitting name for a creature as formidable and dangerous as she.

"Móðir Skaði, the Queen of the Skaði-flær, is a formidable and terrifying creature. Her massive body is covered in a chitinous exoskeleton that is nearly impenetrable, and her sharp mandibles are capable of shearing through even the hardest of materials.

Her multifaceted eyes gleam with an otherworldly intelligence, and her movements are graceful and controlled, suggesting a cunning that belies her insect-like appearance. She is the leader of her kin, and the dwarves of Skórnid-líf tremble at the mere mention of her name.

Móðir Skaði's rule over the Skaði-flær is absolute, and she commands a fierce loyalty from her subjects. She is known to lead her armies in raids against the dwarves, seeking to consume all in her path, and her tactics are brutal and effective.

Her lair, deep within the caverns of Skórnid-líf, is a place of darkness and death, and few have ever returned from a visit to her domain. Móðir Skaði is a creature to be feared and respected, for she is a ruler of darkness and a harbinger of destruction."

"Móðir Skaði towers over her kin, her massive body easily reaching twice the height of an average dwarf. Her exoskeleton is a gleaming black, as if forged from obsidian, and her mandibles are like serrated blades, capable of cutting through stone and metal with ease.

She has 6 spindly legs, which are covered in barbed spines and end in razor-sharp claws. These legs are incredibly agile and allow her to move with grace and precision, darting through the caverns of Skórnid-líf with ease.

Her multifaceted eyes, gleaming like diamonds in the darkness, are capable of seeing in even the lowest levels of light. They also betray her otherworldly intelligence, suggesting a cunning that is far beyond that of an ordinary insect.

Móðir Skaði's body is adorned with a crest of jagged spines that runs down the length of her back, and her thorax is covered in a network of pulsing veins that appear to glow with an inner light. She is a formidable and awe-inspiring creature, and those who have faced her in battle describe her as an unstoppable force."
