The Bloodward of Skórnid-líf is a powerful protective barrier that separates the dwarves from the dangers that lie above. Created through the sacrifice of many of their kin, the Bloodward is said to be infused with the very essence of the dwarves' ancestors, imbuing it with tremendous strength and resilience.

The Bloodward is said to be an imposing and fearsome sight, a great red wall that rises up from the depths of the earth, stained by the blood of those who gave their lives to protect their people. Despite its dark and macabre appearance, the Bloodward is a source of pride and protection for the dwarves, and they tend to it with reverence and care, keeping its magic strong and vibrant.

Beyond the Bloodward, the land is said to be a barren and desolate wasteland, scarred by the Reaper Affliction and the ravages of time. It is a place of darkness and danger, where the spirits of the dead still roam and where the very earth is said to boil and churn with the energy of the Helgrafen.

The Bloodward remains the dwarves' only line of defense against the horrors that lie above, and they guard it with vigilance and determination, never forgetting the sacrifices that were made to protect their people and ensure their survival.

how ever cracks are starting to appear in the Bloodward, and the dwarves are beginning to fear that it may not be enough to keep the horrors of the surface at bay. They are beginning to wonder if they will be able to hold out against the forces that threaten to destroy all they know, are more blood sacrifices required or is there another way. can the evils on the surface be defeated what about the evil that lurks below? 

with danger above and below life is looking grim.
