Skórnid-líf, a world shrouded in darkness, was once a thriving land of towering mountains and rolling hills. But the arrival of the Dauoi Veiker, the reaper affliction, changed all that. The surface was devastated, leaving the dwarves, the hardy inhabitants of Skórnid-líf, with no choice but to flee to the depths below.

The dwarves have adapted to life in the underground tunnels and caverns, carving out a new existence among the shadows. Despite the danger that lurks above, they have found a way to survive and even thrive in the darkness. With their stout hearts and their unbreakable spirit, the dwarves of Skórnid-líf persevere, reminding all that beneath the darkness, there is life."
